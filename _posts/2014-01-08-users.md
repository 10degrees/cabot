### Adding new users

Add new users via the Django admin. It's linked to from the nav bar:

![Access to Django Admin](/images/django-admin-link.png)

Once there, click **+ Add** to add a new user.

### Configuring telephones

Once a user is added, if you want them to receive telephone and/or SMS alerts you should add a mobile number via the **Alert subscriptions** page (linked from the nav bar):

Click the <i class="icon-edit"></i> edit icon next to a user to configure:

![User contact configuration](/images/user-mobile-edit.png)

**You must have correctly configured your Twilio and/or Hipchat credentials (see [Configuration](configuration.html)) for these settings to have any effect.**

*   `Mobile number` - in format `XXYYYYYYYYYY` where `X`s are country code and `Y`s are local number with any leading zeroes stripped.
    *   e.g. `447842555555` (UK mobile) or `16135554321` (Canada phone).
    *   No leading `+`, `011` or `011`.
    *   Cabot currently uses [Twilio](http://twilio.com) so anything Twilio will take is fine.
*   `Hipchat alias` - the name used to @mention a user in Hipchat, without the leading `@`. Must match exactly for popup notifications to work.
    *   e.g. `david`
*   `Fallback alert user` - this is the user who will receive telephone and other alerts if nobody else is [marked in the rota](rota.html) as being on duty.
