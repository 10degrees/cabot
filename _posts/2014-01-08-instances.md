### What is an instance?

Apart from grouping checks by [service](services.html) Cabot also allows you to group them by hosts that provide your services.

Additionally when creating an new instance a new default ICMP check (ping) is created automatically to immediately start checking your host uptime.

### Adding an instance

Adding an instance is easy - just click **New â–¾** and then **Instance**.

If you have already configured Checks that you want to make part of the instance, you can select them in the Status checks field.

You can also connect some of your Services with the newly created instance by using Service set field.
